# 多多随身 (DuoDuo Pocket): connecting and using the iPhone app

What the owner does on the phone, with the labels the app shows. Read it at `SKILL.md` step 6, or
when the owner asks about a screen or a banner. Source and design:
[openduo/pocket-ios](https://github.com/openduo/pocket-ios) (`README.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
`docs/design/native-app.md`). The app's UI is Simplified Chinese with an English localization; it
follows the phone's language. Labels below are given as zh / en.

## What the app is

- One app is one room: a chat with 多多, plus hold-to-talk voice notes, photos and files, and an
  ambient mode in which the phone listens to the room and speaks the answers.
- It embeds its own Tailscale node (tsnet, userspace). No VPN profile is installed, and the
  phone's system Tailscale app is not involved. The node appears in the tailnet as
  `duoduo-pocket`.
- Every connection dials out from the phone to the channel host; nothing listens on the phone.
- History comes from the channel and is cached on the phone for offline reading.

## Onboarding

First launch has three steps.

| Step | Screen (zh / en)                         | What the owner does                                                                                                                                                  | Done when                               |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1    | 先连上你的网络 / Connect to your network | 登录 Tailscale / Log In to Tailscale, sign in with the account of the tailnet this host is on, return to the app                                                     | The node is running                     |
| 2    | 找到多多 / Find DuoDuo                   | Host `<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net`; room `<room_id>`; port `443` and HTTPS on (the defaults, folded under 端口 · HTTPS / Port · HTTPS). Then 检查连接 / Check Connection | Three checks pass, then 继续 / Continue |
| 3    | 添加 Passport / Add Passport             | Pair the Passport ([passport.md](passport.md)), or skip                                                                                                              | Paired or skipped                       |

The step 2 check runs in order: Tailscale connected → `GET /healthz` 200 (with latency) →
`GET /api/state?room=<room_id>` 200 with `daemon_ok` and `cerebellum_ok`. If the room is wrong
and the channel has more than one room, the app lists them (这个频道有这些房间： / Rooms on this
channel:) and a tap fills one in. 稍后再说 / Later saves without passing.

Signing in with an account of another tailnet is the most common mistake: the phone then cannot
resolve the host. The node and the channel host must be in the same tailnet.

Permissions are asked when first needed: microphone on the first hold or ambient on, Bluetooth on
the Passport step, Photos and Camera on first use.

## Using it

| Action                                 | How                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type                                   | The composer at the bottom                                                                                                                                                    |
| Voice note                             | 按住说话 / Hold to Talk: hold, speak, release to send. The transcript appears, then the answer                                                                                |
| Photos and files                       | The attach menu in the composer. Over the channel's upload limit: 文件太大                                                                                                    |
| Ambient mode (环境模式 / Ambient mode) | The waveform button at the top right. While on, the phone listens to the room, holds its capture seat, and speaks answers. Tap again to open the call view; 关闭 turns it off |
| Passport                               | The device chip at the top right, beside the waveform button                                                                                                                  |

- Answers are spoken only while ambient mode is on. Otherwise they are shown (and on the
  Passport's screen).
- Only one device holds a room's capture seat. If another device has it, ambient mode shows
  另一台设备在听 / Another device is listening and 在这台手机上听 / Listen on this iPhone to take it.
- Ambient mode can keep listening with the app in the background or the phone locked: Settings,
  离开 App 后继续听 / Keep listening outside the app. Turn it off to stop when the app leaves.

Host, port, HTTPS and room are stored in UserDefaults; nothing about the host is built into the
app. Logs are under `Documents/logs`, visible in the Files app, so the owner can share them.
