# Running the ambient channel

Day-to-day work after setup. Read it from `SKILL.md` "Later", or when the owner asks to restart,
upgrade, add a room, stop, or move the channel. Each change needs the owner's yes
(`SKILL.md` policy 4); reads do not.

Contents:

- Check
- Restart
- Upgrade
- Add a room
- Change the cerebellum or its token
- Serve port taken
- Stop and roll back
- Move to another host

## Check

```bash
duoduo channel ambient status
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:<port>/healthz
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:<port>/api/state?room=<room_id>"     # daemon_ok, cerebellum_ok, config_issues
tailscale serve status                                         # the entry to 127.0.0.1:<port> is there
```

## Restart

`duoduo channel ambient stop`, then `duoduo channel ambient start`. A restart drops every
connected device; the app reconnects by itself, and ambient mode must be turned on again if it was
on. After it: the Check above, and a `cerebellum_halt` from before the restart is cleared.

Restart after any `.env` change, a new room, or an upgrade.

## Upgrade

```bash
duoduo channel list                                   # current version
duoduo channel install @openduo/channel-ambient       # with the owner's yes
duoduo channel ambient stop && duoduo channel ambient start
```

- The install does not overwrite an existing kind config (`config/ambient.md`). If the release
  notes say the `bridge:` block gained a key, the channel refuses to start and names the key: copy
  it from the new package's `config/ambient.md` with the owner's yes.
- If the cerebellum is run by someone else, ask first which wire version it serves. A channel
  newer or older than the cerebellum supports halts with `unsupportedProtocol`.

## Add a room

One room per phone, so a second phone gets a second room:

```bash
duoduo channel ambient room add <room_id> --workspace <absolute path> --runtime <runtime> \
  --name "<display name>" --pocket
```

Then restart, and the second phone sets the same host with the new room. Rooms on one channel share
its port and serve entry, and each room is its own session with its own history.

A room for a browser page or an e-ink tablet in a physical room (always listening, answers spoken)
is created without `--pocket`. Opening it: `https://<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net/?room=<room_id>`; the
microphone needs HTTPS or `127.0.0.1`.

Removing a room is deleting its directory, which deletes its history and notes. Do not do it; tell
the owner what it would delete and let them decide and do it.

## Change the cerebellum or its token

- New URL: with the owner's yes, replace the `AMBIENT_CEREBELLUM_URL` line, then restart.
- New token: the owner deletes the old `AMBIENT_CEREBELLUM_TOKEN` line and runs the `read -rs`
  command of `SKILL.md` step 2 again. Check with the `grep -q` line, then restart.
- The owner moves from a hosted cerebellum to their own: same two keys; nothing else on this host
  changes. Speaker numbers and usage records stay on the old cerebellum's host.

## Serve port taken

`tailscale serve status` shows `:443` already served to something else. Do not change that entry.
Options for the owner:

| Option                                                | Change                                                                                                                                               | Risk                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Another HTTPS port on the same node, for example 8443 | `tailscale serve --bg --https=8443 http://127.0.0.1:<port>`; `AMBIENT_HTTP_ORIGINS=https://<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8443`; the app's port set to 8443 | Not measured with the app; a tailnet ACL must allow the port |
| The owner moves the other service themselves          | None by you                                                                                                                                          | It is their service                                          |
| Run the channel on another host that runs the daemon  | A separate setup                                                                                                                                     | More to maintain                                             |

Never serve the channel under a path of another site (`--set-path`): the page and API use
absolute paths and break.

## Stop and roll back

| Undo            | Command                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The channel     | `duoduo channel ambient stop`                                                                                          |
| The serve entry | `tailscale serve --https=443 off` (only the entry you added; read `serve status` before and after)                     |
| The `.env` keys | Remove the `AMBIENT_*` lines with the owner's yes; the owner removes the token line                                    |
| The app         | Settings › Tailscale › 退出登录 / Log Out on the phone; remove `duoduo-pocket` in the admin console if the owner wants |
| The Passport    | Forget it in iOS Settings › Bluetooth; re-pair on the device                                                           |

Stopping keeps every room, its history and notes. The room's history is in
`<runtime_dir>/var/channels/ambient-<room_id>/`; back it up before moving anything.

## Move to another host

The channel runs beside a daemon; the rooms belong to that daemon. A move is a new setup on the
new host from `SKILL.md` step 1, with new rooms, and the phone given the new host name. Carrying a
room's history and session across daemons is not covered by this skill: tell the owner, and back
up the old room directories before anything. Stop the old channel before starting the new one if
they share a room id on the same cerebellum: the second link for a room halts the first
(`superseded`).
