# Limiting the phone to the channel: a tailnet ACL draft

The channel has no login. Everyone in the owner's tailnet who the tailnet policy lets reach this
host's port 443 can open the room, read its history and talk to the agent. On a tailnet with the
default allow-all policy that is every device and every user in it. Read this when the owner asks
who can reach the room, shares the tailnet with other people, or wants the phone limited to the
channel.

You draft; the owner applies. Never edit the tailnet policy yourself, even with console access:
the policy also governs devices and routes you cannot see (`SKILL.md` policy 2).

## What the app gives the policy to match

- The app joins as an ordinary device of the user who logged in, named `duoduo-pocket`. It
  advertises no tag.
- So a rule can name the phone either by a tag the owner assigns in the admin console (Draft A) or
  by its tailnet address (Draft B). A rule on the owner's user alone would also cover every other
  device of that user.
- What the phone needs: TCP 443 on the channel host. Nothing listens on the phone, so nothing needs
  to reach it.

Two goals, and the owner picks:

| Goal                                                           | Change                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The phone reaches only the channel                             | Rules that let the phone's identity reach anything else are narrowed         |
| Only the phone (and the owner's own devices) reach the channel | Rules that let other users or tags reach the channel host's 443 are narrowed |

Both mean narrowing an existing rule if the tailnet is on allow-all (`"src": ["*"]`,
`"dst": ["*:*"]`), because a broad rule also matches the tagged phone and the channel host.

## Draft A: tag the phone

The owner creates `tag:pocket`, then in the admin console, Machines, opens `duoduo-pocket` and
sets its tag to `tag:pocket` (Edit ACL tags). A tagged device stops being the user's device for
policy purposes: rules on `autogroup:member` or the owner's user no longer match it.

```jsonc
{
  "tagOwners": {
    "tag:pocket": ["autogroup:admin"],
  },
  "hosts": {
    "duoduo-channel": "<channel host tailnet IP>",
  },
  "acls": [
    // The phone reaches the channel's HTTPS port and nothing else.
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["tag:pocket"],
      "dst": ["duoduo-channel:443"],
    },
    // Every other existing rule stays. A rule whose src is "*" also matches tag:pocket:
    // replace that "*" with what it is meant to cover (autogroup:member, the existing tags).
  ],
  "tests": [
    {
      "src": "tag:pocket",
      "accept": ["duoduo-channel:443"],
      "deny": ["duoduo-channel:22"],
    },
    // Plus one accept per kind of destination the owner reaches today (see below).
    { "src": "<owner>@<domain>", "accept": ["duoduo-channel:22"] },
  ],
}
```

If the channel host is itself tagged, use its tag (`tag:<x>:443`) instead of the `hosts` entry.

## Draft B: match the phone by address

No tag; the phone stays the owner's device. Read its address from the admin console or from
`tailscale status` on this host (the line for `duoduo-pocket`).

```jsonc
{
  "hosts": {
    "duoduo-pocket": "<phone node tailnet IP>",
    "duoduo-channel": "<channel host tailnet IP>",
  },
  "acls": [
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["duoduo-pocket"],
      "dst": ["duoduo-channel:443"],
    },
    // Rules that match the owner's user (autogroup:member, "*", the user) also match the phone.
    // Keep the phone limited only if those rules are narrowed for it, which a user-based rule
    // cannot express. Prefer Draft A when the goal is "the phone reaches only the channel".
  ],
  "tests": [{ "src": "duoduo-pocket", "accept": ["duoduo-channel:443"] }],
}
```

Draft B is mainly useful for the second goal: letting the phone in while other users' devices are
kept off the channel host. If the app logs out and in again, the node may get a new address; check
the `hosts` entry after any re-login.

## Applying it safely

The owner applies the change in the admin console, Access controls. Before they save, give them:

1. **A backup.** They copy the current policy text somewhere first.
2. **What every broad rule covers today.** List from the admin console: the owner's devices, other
   users' devices, tags in use, subnet routes, exit nodes, devices shared in. Never replace `*`
   with a shorter list without that enumeration: a careless narrowing cuts the owner off from
   subnet routes and shared devices.
3. **The exact diff**, with a `tests` block that asserts the owner still reaches one device of each
   kind above. Tailscale refuses to save a policy whose tests fail, which guards against a lockout.

After they save, check:

```bash
tailscale ping <an existing peer>          # still answers from this host
```

and the owner reopens the app: 检查连接 / Check Connection must still pass all three checks.
For Draft A, the owner also checks that from the phone nothing else is reachable that was before
(for example a NAS page), if they want the first goal proven.

Record in the handoff note: which draft, the tag or address, where the backup is, and how to roll
back (restore the backup, or remove the added rule, tag and `hosts` entries).
